Detailed description of how the DIComms would work.

Precurosor: Payment system(s) (named Bank for short) and shipping services that are used in the application register public
DIDs and required schemas and creddefs

1. A vendor registers with the website. A public DID is created (NYM transaction)
	along with the required schemas and credential definitions.

2. The vendor creates a market listing. This listing, when submitted, is now searchable by users of
	the application through app code. Storage/transmisiso thorugh IPFS (ideally)

3. A user finds a market listing. They initiate a DIDComm session through the invite URL that
	found on the listing.

	Credential proposal for payment information
	    If item available:
		    Credential offer
		    Credential request
		    Credential issuance

		else:
		     problem report

5. The User, proves to the payment service that the given payment endpoint is expecting the given amount of funds. Could be potentially useful for any potential implementations of conflict resoluiton.
        Aries protocol:
            Credential proposal
            Credential offer
            Credential req
            Credentual issueance

6. Through the payment service, the user pays the required amount to the vendor.

7. The agent of the payment service issues the User a credential containing a the transaction ID (or the amount and endpoint, depends)
        Aries protocol:
            Credential offer
            Credential req
            Credential issuance

8. The user proves to the vendor they paid for the items(s)
    Aries protocol:
        Proof proposal
        Proof request
        Proof presentation
            (Proof verification)

    ----- Current Uncertainty: Specifics of interaction details between the Vendor and the Shipper. ------
    ----- How a vendor informs a shipping service that they have received a parcel in particlar ------
9. The Vendor packages the users goods, and issues them a credential for package ownership. The vendor ships the package to the shipping service.
        Aries protocol:
        credential offer
        credential request
        credential issuance

    --cool idea---
10. Perhaps through a QR invite code present on the package itself, the shipping service initiates connection with the vendor, and issues credential that they are in possession
    of given package number.
        Aries protocol:
            credential offer
            credential request
            credential issuance


11. The vendor proves to the user that the shipping service is in possession of the parcel
    Aries protocol:
        Proof proposal
        Proof request
        Proof presentation
            (verification)


12. User initaites connection with the shipping service (through endpoint in DIDDoc / publicly available invitation).
    Shipping service requsets proof of package ownership
        Aries protocol:
            Proof proposal
            Proof request
            Proof presentation
                (verification)


13. The vendor ships the package through address (can be a self-attested part of the proof). Fin

	Credential schemas required:                    Issuer:         holder:
	    Payment agreement credential                Vendor          User
	    Successful payment credential               Bank            User
	    Package (ownership) credential              Vendor          User
	    Receipt of package credential               Shipper         Vendor

	Proofs required:                        prover:      verifier:
	    Proof of payment agreement:         User         Bank
	    Proof of payment success            User         Vendor
	    Proof of receipt of package         Vendor       User
	    Proof of ownership                  User         Shipper



CRED EXCHANGE START POINTS:

1. Payment request: Crendetial proposal [User->Vendor]
2. Payment credential: Credential offer [Bankl->User]
3. Payment proof: Proof proposal [User->Vendor]
4. Package credntial: Credential offer [Vendor->User]
5. Receipt credential: Credential offer [Shipper->Bank]
6.
